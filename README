Applied patches
===============
Most, if not all, of these are taken from elsewhere. The single tag set modification breaks most other patches, so I have to manually patch everything, often rewriting patches from scratch, but the original idea and code still come from other people.

* Single Tag Set
* Status Colors
* Status bar padding removed
* Monocle Count
* Centered Floating
* Push
* Cycle
* Gapless Grid
* Pertag
* Status drawn on all monitors
* Function to focus first found urgent client (needs to be fixed because of single tag set patch)
* Hide unused tags in bar (dynamic tags from Subtle)
